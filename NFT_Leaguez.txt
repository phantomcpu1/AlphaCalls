NFT Leaguez Project Outline

Minting price: 2 sol

Information:

    NFT Leaguez is a next-generation play-to-earn gaming experience based on basketball.

    Each NFT has a unique combination of special traits that are linked to performance stats such as, shooting, speed, passing, ball handling, dunk/jumping,
    defense, rebounding, and height

    Every game that is played will be simulated by an immutable algorithm that determines the outcome.

    Each round will allow a player to select 3 NFTs from their digital roster & then watch the simulation of the outcome.

    Financial rewards for winning games

    The total supply of the Leaguez is 13,000. The initial genesis drop, launching July 15th, is 1020 of the 13,000.

    The 2nd mint will happen a couple months after the genesis mint

    Link for their parent company Stadio can be found here https://stadio.global/

    If you don't have three of their NFTs then you will be provided with one or two randomly generated players to take their places

    Adidas partnership with officially licensed merchandise

    Interviews were conducted with NBA and NBL professional athletes for game launch marketing

    Full time development team

    Financial rewards for winning games

    Initial supply is low so the floor price will be high at launch

    All founders have backgrounds in tech and have each succesfully founded and build their own companies.

    Active discord especially for an NFT project whos release is 15 days away

    Founders are active in the discord chats

    Art work looks great

    Looks like it may be the most professional web3 game ever made

    Incredible trailer, https://twitter.com/NFTLeaguez/status/1542613868257906688?s=20&t=N1cvAIJg3Bs-AvfzLLDrNg

    Founders have connections to founder of Trippin Ape Tribe

    Contract drawn up with 4 key players

    weekly development calls with magic eden.

Cons:

    High minting price

    Founders don't have many followers on their individual twitter pages and some of the followers they do have are fake.

    Founders don't have experience launching NFT projects

    High supply so you may want to sell before 2nd mint happens but the 2nd mint is supposed to be a higher price so that may actually raise the floor price.

    Only 130 upvotes on magic eden which is very low

    No real gameplay footage, but snapshots of animation from the game can be found in the trailer

    Game release is months away so hype may die down before it releases
