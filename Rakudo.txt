Pros

    Lots of hype

    SOL Big Brain who is a major crypto influencer has 208k followers on twitter who said a bunch of smart people are bullish about this project

    Profits from mint will go towards marketing and expanding dev team

    Whitelist spots over allocated so it will likely sell out before they go public

    Shakudo which is the parent company behind Rakkudo is partnered with Nvidia, Cyxtera, ORACLE, and Vector Institute

    Shakudo is also partnered with Udder Chaos, MonkeDAO, DegenDAO, and Liberty Square HQ

    Holder benefits which can be found in the information section above

    All team members are beyond qualified







Cons

    May be extremely difficult to get whitelist since there is obvious way to be noticed by the team.

    The lack of cons may mean the team is covering up whatever defects this project may have, or they just have an amazing project.
