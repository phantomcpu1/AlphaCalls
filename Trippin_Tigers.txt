Mint Date: July 6, 9AM

Information

    Pretty standard NFT based on Tigers

    NFT can be staked for $ROAR token

    $ROAR is used for auctions, raffles, mutations, fusions, and subscription/minting of the NFT suite of tools
    that will be provided to holders

    Mutations are where using $ROAR tokens holders will be able to mutate their NFTs to 
    “Transcend” to heavenly forces or “Fall” to join the Underworld. There will be weekly/monthly
    competitions between the two forces and the winners will get a bonus of $ROAR token awarded to them.

    Fusions are where the Trippin Tigers collection partners with another collection in order to create
    a fusion of NFTs

    Reveal is immediate on mint

    Suite of tools info
        Includes a Sniper bot for both Magiceden and Opensea. 
        This will include graphs and data on NFTs in both SOL and ETH in real time. 
        This will also include a dedicated analyst to give daily call outs and information. 
        The devs plan to build out the details of this after mint as they see how much funding they can allocate towards this component.

    NFT can be staked for $ROAR token

    Most twitter posts have around 500 likes but the most recent one has 1.7K likes

    Holders have access to "a Suite of NFT tools including a sniping and minting bot as well as a artist 1/1 marketplace."
    (More information on the suite of NFT tools can be found in the Information section)

    98% royalties until mint out to discourage selling before mint is over

    over 4,000 manually submitted wallets for the whitelist

    Very active discord

    Strong community

    Plans to privately dox with Followship DAO

    Owner talks in discord chats atleast once a day usually around midnight

    Expected to sell out

    Annoucements have reactions reaching the thousands (this means their discord is active)

    The suite of tools is a reason for holders to continue holding instead of just selling





Cons

    Very unlikely to be able to mint unless you are whitelisted

    Owner is not publicly doxxed and there is just zero info on them so there is no way of knowing whether they are an MIT graduate or a junkie however they are 
    privately doxxed so this isn't a rug, Trippin Ape Tribe was the same way and they turned out to be one of the top collections on Magic Eden

    Only 30 whitelist spots left and three days until mint so if you want to mint you better get one of those 30 spots if not you can just buy it on Magic Eden after mint is over
