Realized Rhapsody Project

Mint Price: 3.5 sol
Mint Date: July 10th
Supply: 7900



Information:

    NFT functions as a pass to their own NFT insights tool

    The real product here is the NFT insights tool not the NFT so rarity shouldn't matter, just buy at floor price

    Extra features will be provided to wallets holding more than one qualified NFT

    If mint doesn't sell out then the remaining NFTs will be placed on exchanges at mint price

    If mint doesn't sell out then the remaining NFTs will be placed on exchanges at mint price

    No additional NFTs will be issued within 90 days of the original mint

    If an NFT is transferred between wallets it is disqualified for 24 hours

    The only way to reinstate a disqualified NFT is to pay a sin tax

    You can tell if your NFT is qualified on their website

    Team is privately doxxed to Magic Eden

Pros:

    If an NFT is purchased or listed below minting price it is disqualified for access to the NFT insights product so you shouldn't be able
    to lose money if you minted or bought at minting price.

    The NFT insights tool looks amazing and should be the reason you mint, if you do decide to mint

    16 analytic features will be released at launch with atleast 14 more on the way

    The most advanced NFT insights tool to ever be created for solana NFTs

    All team members with the exception of cryptomane and BDC have many accomplishments and are beyond qualified

    Recommended by Thomas who is one of the Co-founders of NFT Leaguez

    Followed by SOL big brain who is a major influencer in the crypto space

    Plans to release features incrementally and often as to not let hype die down



Cons:

    chaotic Discord

    half the people in the discord talk like bots

    Expensive mint

    NFTs being disqualified for access to NFT insights tool doesn't punish the person who sells but it does punish the person who buys so it is a very flawed system.
    This system is flawed to the point that it could be the downfall of this project.
